              Commentary:</u><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bitcoin has proven the value of the
            blockchain and the UTX0 architecture as a better form of
            money by remaining the dominant cryptocurrency by a large
            margin. Bitcoin's design has also demonstrated excellent
            security. Surrounding services, institutions, and people
            have fallen victim to vulnerabilities, but bitcoin has
            proven to be unhackable. Ethereum and other smart contract
            based projects promised to extend bitcoin into new
            capabilities with similar security. But the reality has
            proven otherwise, with smart contract platform hacks and
            bugs causing increasingly larger monetary losses on a daily
            basis. Evrmore seeks to enhance the proven Ravencoin
            UTXO-based asset protocol, based on bitcoin, to enable
            Distributed Finance and Commerce functionality WITHOUT
            general-purpose smart contracts and WITH the security of
            bitcoin.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <u>History:</u><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evrmore (originally called Evermore) was
            proposed within the Ravencoin community as an aggressive
            roadmap to participate in the DeFi economy with new features
            and new strategies. Evrmore's technology generated great
            interest within the community, but Evrmore differed from
            Ravencoin's established cautious approach. The perceived
            risks of changing Ravencoin's feature set and style
            motivated some members to suggest that Evrmore should be a
            separate project within the Ravencoin community. Evrmore is
            being built by current and former Ravencoin developers,
            hodlers, and miners who understand these issues and
            concerns, and who appreciate the value of the style which
            Ravencoin has chosen. Evrmore is a parallel effort using a
            different set of trade-offs with different goals and
            different strategies. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One area of controversy in the Ravencoin
            community has been how to financially support the
            development of new initiatives like Evrmore. Ravencoin
            itself was founded by Overstock corporation's Medici
            subsidiary, who also funded its development. Medici launched
            Ravencoin according to the Bitcoin model, taking no
            pre-mined coins or other financial interest. Nevertheless,
            Medici spent roughly $2.5 million on Ravencoin development
            from 2017 until terminating its last employee in late 2020.
            Since that time Ravencoin has been supported by some
            donations, but not sufficient to attract developer interest.
            <br>
            <!-- end of menu items   --> <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The community members driving the Evrmore
            initiative understand the value of the Bitcoin and Ravencoin
            ethos, but believe that compromise is necessary and
            worthwhile in order to be competitive in the marketplace.
            DeFi is a dynamic fast-moving market which requires full
            time software developers and a mechanism to pay for their
            salaries. To that end, Evrmore charges a 10% development
            funding fee on all mining rewards. Evrmore has a 2778 EVR
            coinbase block reward, of which 2500.2 is paid to the miner
            and 277.8 is retained by the Evrmore Foundation to fund core
            development. <br>
