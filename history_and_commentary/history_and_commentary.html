              Commentary:</u><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bitcoin has proven the value of the
            blockchain and the UTX0 architecture as a better form of
            money by remaining the dominant cryptocurrency by a large
            margin. Bitcoin's design has also demonstrated excellent
            security. Surrounding services, institutions, and people
            have fallen victim to vulnerabilities, but bitcoin has
            proven to be unhackable. Ethereum and other smart contract
            based projects promised to extend bitcoin into new
            capabilities with similar security. But the reality has
            proven otherwise, with smart contract platform hacks and
            bugs causing increasingly larger monetary losses on a daily
            basis. Evrmore seeks to enhance the proven Ravencoin asset
            protocol, based on bitcoin, to enable Distributed Finance
            functionality WITHOUT general-purpose smart contracts and
            WITH the security of bitcoin.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <u>History:</u><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evrmore (originally called Evermore) was
            proposed within the Ravencoin community as an aggressive
            roadmap to participate in the DeFi economy with new features
            and new strategies. Evrmore's technology generated great
            interest within the community, but Evrmore differed from
            Ravencoin's established cautious approach. The perceived
            risks of radically changing Ravencoin's feature set and
            style motivated some members to suggest that Evrmore should
            be a separate project within the Ravecoin community. Evrmore
            is being built by current and former Ravencoin developers,
            hodlers, and miners who understand these issues and
            concerns, and who appreciate the value of the style which
            Ravencoin has chosen. Evrmore is a parallel effort using a
            different set of trade-offs with different goals and
            different strategies. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One area of controversy in the Ravencoin
            community has been how to financially support the
            development of new initiatives like Evrmore. Ravencoin
            itself was founded by Overstock corporation's Medici
            subsidiary, who also funded its development. Medici launched
            Ravencoin according to the Bitcoin model, taking no
            pre-mined coins or other financial interest. Nevertheless,
            Medici spent roughly $2.5 million on Ravencoin development
            from 2017 until terminating its last employee in late 2020.
            The Ravencoin community has continued to be very active, but
            funding has been limited to small bounties, and the last
            release of the core node software for mainnet was on
            2020-Dec-07.<br>
            <!-- end of menu items   --> <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The community members driving the Evrmore
            initiative understand the value of the Bitcoin and Ravencoin
            ethos, but believe that compromise is necessary and
            worthwhile in order to be competitive in the DeFi
            marketplace. DeFi is a dynamic fast-moving market which
            requires full time software developers and a mechanism to
            pay for their salaries. To that end, Evrmore charges a 10%
            development funding fee on all mining rewards. Evrmore will
            initially have a 2750 EVR coinbase block reward, of which
            2500 is paid to the miner and 250 is retained by the Evrmore
            Foundation to fund core development. Coinbase payouts will
            follow a halving schedule, halving roughly every three
            years.<br>
