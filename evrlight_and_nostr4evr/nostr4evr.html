            vision by providing access to diverse digital assets and the
            mechanism to buy and sell them peer-to-peer using the

            <u><b>Thoughts on things worth building:</b></u><br>
            <br>
            Whenever possible, things should be accomplished as simply
            as possible and without creating new NIPs or
            over-complicating current NIPs<br>
            <br>
            NIP-46 (Nostr Connect) provides a signing service so that
            apps don't need direct access to private keys. The NIP
            should be generalized to allow the selection of signing
            algorithm<br>
            <br>
            NIP-47 (Wallet Connect) describes a way for clients to
            access a remote Lightning wallet through a standardized
            protocol. There should be a new NIP or a re-write of this
            NIP to support more general wallets including the
            functionality which would be useful for Evrmore<br>
            <br>
            NIP-57 (Lightning Zaps) defines event types for recording
            lightning payments between users.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -It creates two new kinds of notes: kind
            9735 (A Zap) and kind 9734 (A Zap request)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -It requires:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) A Zap-compatible
            lightning wallet (like Alby or Wallet of Satoshi)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) A client that has
            implemented Zaps (like Damus, Amethyst, Iris, or Snort)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Have your lightning
            address where you'll receive Zaps set in your Nostr profile
            in the LN address or LUD-06 field.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -There needs to be a way of doing this
            for more general asset types. Not sure whether it is best to
            re-write this NIP more generally, create a new NIP, or find
            a different approach<br>
            <br>
            NIP-58 (Badges) are a very specific limited type of asset.
            This NIP should be removed or generalized to support a more
            comprehensive asset type description.<br>
            <br>
            Nostr-EvrControl<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -like
            https://github.com/joelklabo/nostr-control &amp;
            https://github.com/joelklabo/nostrify<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -a utility which allows you talk to your
            Evrmore core node (evrmored/-qt) node over Nostr DMs. It
            also will send you events from your node over Nostr DMs.<br>
            <br>
            Nost-EVR-Address-Convert- A utility to convert a Nostr
            public key (npub or hex format) into an Evrmore address<br>
            <br>
            A method or service where people can enter their nostr
            npubkey and preferred relay in order to be notified whenever
            anything is transferred into their equivalent Evrmore
            address.<br>
            <br>
            Nostr could be used as a public bulletin board for asset
            owners who want to post a half-transaction "offer to sell"
            an asset using the 2-step atomic swap method. That method
            requires no interaction between the buyer and seller beyond
            the seller posting an offer and a buyer later accepting that
            offer. Such offers are built on Evrmore as half-transactions
            using SIGHASH_SINGLE:ANYONECANPAY.<br>
            <br>
            EvrLight provides a built-in DEX for trades between
            BTC-Lightning and EVR or EVR assets. The only thing missing
            is the orderbook, which Nostr can provide.
            <br>
            <br>
            Would it be useful to be able to post a raw Evrmore
            transaction in a Nostr note and have it automatically be
            transmitted?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -That capability allows total flexibility
            on the types of Evrmore operations which can be executed
            from within Nostr<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -But it assumes that the application
            provides the information needed for that capability to be
            useful. Otherwise the user would need an Evrmore wallet and
            explorer. <br>

            Authentication Tokens: Nostr user-IDs (npub addresses) can
            be translated into addresses on Evrmore. Holding an asset at
            that address could provides the nostr user with automatic
            login access to a website hosting subscription content or an
            event. When the asset is transferred (sold) to a different
            address (nostr user-ID and Evrmore address), login access
            would transfer to the new nostr user.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Implementation: When someone requests
            access to a web server, the user presents their public key
            to the web server. The server then presents an access
            challenge and asks the user to sign it using the private key
            corresponding to the public key. The server then uses the
            plaintext challenge and the signature to calculate the
            public key. From the public key it calculates the address,
            and then checks the blockchain to verify that the address
            holds the required access token. <br>
