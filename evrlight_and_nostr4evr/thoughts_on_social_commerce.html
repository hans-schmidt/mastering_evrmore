            <!-- start of main content   --> <br>
            The term Social Commerce refers to the increasing
            integration of social media into the buying and selling of
            goods. In the simplest sense it refers to changes taking
            place in consumer sales. The financial power of marketing
            and advertising should not be undervalued. They paid for the
            entire history of free broadcast radio and television, and
            today they power both Google/Alphabet and Facebook/Meta. <br>
            <br>
            Social Commerce has global relevance, just as social media
            and Distributed Finance do. That is why the wealthiest man
            in the world is interested in spending his time working on
            Twitter/X. Elon Musk has explained that his goal for
            Twitter/X is to follow the example of WeChat, the large
            Chinese social media platform. WeChat is owned by China's
            Tencent Holdings Ltd, which began in 1998 building a social
            media application. The company has since then branched into
            other related businesses, especially video games, but WeChat
            is still key to its success. Tencent has a current marketcap
            of about $400 billion. WeChat's success has come from being
            the first of a growing number of social media platforms
            which tightly integrates a payment platform and in-app
            purchases. The social commerce market has developed farther
            in China than it has in the western world, but it is
            expected to grow larger everywhere.
            <br>
            <br>
            Long term, it is thought that a Social Commerce megacompany
            could be like Facebook/Meta + Paypal + Amazon.

            Zapping on Nostr is an amazing way to instantly send money
            to another Nostr user. But this is only the tip of the
            iceberg of what Nostr can accomplish using peer-to-peer
            decentralized technology.&nbsp; Social Commerce as predicted
            by today's mainstream pundit is a dystopian vision in which
            Fortune 500 companies build shopping carts and checkout
            software and even more tracking into traditional centralized
            social media platforms so that people can click on
            advertisements to accomplish one-click in-app purchasing. In
            truth, it is much more important that next-generation social
            media should empower individuals to maximize their potential
            without being abused by the corporate social media giants.
            Uncensorable communications and uncensorable flexible
            peer-to-peer multi-asset payments are critical to fair
            Social Commerce. Zaps are great for tipping content
            creators, but creators need livable dependable income. Sales
            of live event tickets, subscriptions, coupons, badges,
            authentication tokens, memes, and NFTs are much more
            powerful ways to provide economic support.<br>
            <br>
            NFTs have gotten a bad public image because of the Ethereum
            community's activities tying tokens to jpegs of bored apes,
            which is pointless since the jpeg can trivially be copied
            anyway. But NFTs have real value. A ticket to an in-person
            event with an assigned seat number, or a subscription to a
            certain number of minutes of streaming "back-stage" or
            "privileged insider" access are natural NFTs since each
            token is associated with unique data. The access which they
            provide is best implemented as an NFT rather than just being
            tied to a username/password because the NFT can be
            trade-able. A music enthusiast will be willing to spend more
            money on a concert ticket or subscription to their favorite
            musician if they know that they can resell it if their
            schedule or their taste in music changes. If the NFT is tied
            to an address which is also the purchaser's identity as
            could be done in Nostr, then the buyer would be very
            unlikely to defeat the NFT controls by sharing his private
            key. Moreover, such tickets and subscriptions are obviously
            not securities in the legal sense- artist, bloggers and
            newsletter writers are free to sell as many tickets and
            subscriptions to their work as their followers would like to
            purchase. <br>
            <br>
            From an even wider perspective, Social Commerce may also
            include the integration of social media into the world of
            finance as exemplified by companies like Robinhood. The
            opportunities there are even vastly larger. We hope that
            Bitcoin will someday become the world's money. But money in
            the sense of cash is a small portion of global wealth
            compared to stock markets, the debt market, and especially
            derivatives. <br>

            <u>A few comments about adapting the available technologies
              to address real-world markets:</u>
            <br>
            <br>
            In the cryptocurrency community, we are taught to be super
            sensitive to security. The purists will say to never reuse
            public keys, or to protect every Satoshi behind a multisig
            address. Security is vitally important. But the safeguards
            must be chosen to match the situation, lest they
            unnecessarily complicate the use case. <br>
            <br>
            A few points in particular are worthy of mention:
            <ul>
              <li> For many assets of low or medium value, it is
                convenient and perfectly reasonable to tie them to a
                single key. That is particularly useful when there is a
                key pair which the person uses as their identity, as is
                done with Nostr. Doing so makes it easy to send items to
                those people without knowing anything about them and it
                also simplifies item storage for them. </li>
              <li> In those cases when the user does generate multiple
                keys from a seed, it is often ok to reuse the same keys
                across different blockchains or applications. That makes
                it possible for a person to have a single
                wallet/keychain which serves multiple blockchains while
                also easily preserving the relationship between related
                digital items which reside on different chains. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Of course, these are not practices which should be applied
            to your primary financial accounts, which should remain in
            air-gapped cold wallets with unique addresses. But for
            day-to-day items tied to keys, the security model can be
            loosened to match the value of the item. <br>
            <br>
            Similarly, it is important to understand transaction fees in
            context. When selling tickets and subscriptions, the buyer
            will value the ability to resell what they are buying. But
            the option to do so will most likely be exercised only a
            small number of times. Therefore, even though bundling an
            asset with a small amount of EVR to cover future anticipated
            mining fees limits the number of transactions which can be
            supported without extra effort, for most casual use cases
            that solution will be sufficient. Day traders have different
            needs and can use a native Evrmore wallet or a service which
            supplements their bundled EVR.<br>
