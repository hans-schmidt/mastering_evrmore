            <!-- start of main content   --> <br>
            There is a long history of projects which have attempted to
            implement Assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. The first
            generation, often called "colored coins", such as
            Counterparty and Mastercoin/OmniLayer, suffered from the
            risk of being destroyed if the coins were spent by wallets
            which did not understand their protocol. They also suffered
            from the high fees and slow confirmation times of the
            Bitcoin blockchain. More recently, the Ordinals project is
            similar and is famous for generating large mining fees. <br>
            <br>
            RGB and Taproot-Assets are relatively recent projects
            offering improvements which may prove useful in the future.
            But they are very complex, unintuitive, and more centralized
            because they require critical portions of their data to be
            stored off-chain in some secure way. <br>
            Taproot-Assets is an impressive work of cryptographic
            design. It provides the cryptographic primitives needed to
            store arbitrary data in a UXTO, and it defines a protocol
            for using that to create and track Assets. But it doesn't
            define any standards for the types or characteristics of
            Assets or how the Asset holders interact or are restricted.
            Even for on-chain Taproot Assets, the Asset transactional
            data is stored off-chain with clients (which they would only
            do for assets they own since it costs resources and fees) or
            in a centralized database per asset. <br>
            <br>
            Evrmore, by contrast, is a simple UTXO-based extension of
            the bitcoin design enhanced specifically to support assets,
            which any Bitcoin developer or Lightning developer can
            easily understand and use. <br>
            <br>
            RGB and Taproot-Assets have both made claims that their
            assets can be routed on Bitcoin's Lightning Network.
            OmniLayer, meanwhile, has proposed OmniBOLT, a
            Lightning-like network which would have to be built in
            parallel with Bitcoin's Lightning Network, but which could
            then route USTD (Tether) along with other assets. <br>
            <br>
            But those claims can be misleading to non-experts. So it is
            worth taking a closer look at what they can actually
            deliver. In fact, it is worthwhile to consider what the
            limitations are for ANY assets being routed on the Lightning
            Network. <br>
            <br>
            First just a brief review of Lightning Network
            functionality: The Lightning Network is based on Payment
            Channels. As any Lightning developer or node operator knows,
            one of the biggest challenges in routing payments over a
            multi-hop route of Payment Channels is finding nodes with
            sufficient liquidity. If you want to send X Bitcoins to
            someone else through a multi-hop route, every node along
            that route must have locked up at least X Bitcoins on-chain
            to give them X Bitcoins off-chain in their channel. The
            on-chain Bitcoin are effectively collateral to guarantee the
            IOUs they are handing out off-chain. Moreover, their X
            off-chain Bitcoins must not have already been spent so that
            they still have X liquidity in the correct direction. <br>
            <br>
            That scheme can work very well for fungible items available
            in high volume. It is well suited for Bitcoin, and it could
            be used for any widely-available high-volume stable coin
            like Tether. <br>
            <br>
            On the other end of the scale, Payment Channels don't work
            at all for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). By definition, an NFT
            is unique so that if you own it, none of the Lightning
            Network nodes can own it. End of story. NFTs cannot be
            supported. OmniBOLT says this in their spec, which they
            admit without hesitation since they are only interested in
            Tether. <br>
            <br>
            Between those extremes, there could be fungible tokens which
            are available in only limited supply, or there could be a
            related group of non-fungible tokens which are very similar
            to each other. Taproot-Assets claims to support all these
            cases (including single NFTs) with the ability to do
            multi-hop routing over the Lightning Network. But the way it
            accomplishes that feat is by converting the asset to
            standard Bitcoins when entering the Lightning Network,
            routing the Bitcoins, and then converting the Bitcoins back
            to assets when exiting the Lightning Network. That sounds
            wonderful in principle, but in reality it imposes serious
            limitations in all cases except high-volume stable coins.
            First, such a scheme can only work if there is a universally
            trusted price oracle to dictate the conversion prices.
            Moreover, the Lightning entry and exit nodes must be willing
            to take additional arbitrage risk in holding the asset. The
            Lightning entry node must already be holding that asset and
            be willing to sell it at that price in order to deliver
            Bitcoin into the route. The next-to-last exit node must be
            willing to buy that asset at that price in order to receive
            Bitcoin and deliver the Asset. Lastly, if the assets are
            NFTs, then in addition to requiring a trusted price oracle
            (which is unlikely for an NFT), the data in the NFT which
            makes it unique must be stored off-chain and off-Lightning
            in some trusted way to make the conversions possible. <br>
            <u>Once again, the end result is functionality which in
              truth only works for Bitcoin and high-volume stable coins.
            </u><br>
            <br>
            Now that the inherent limitation of assets on Payment
            Channels has been established, we can compare those designs
            with EvrLight. <br>
            <br>
            To be clear, EvrLight makes it possible to buy and sell
            assets USING Lightning, but not OVER Lightning. Assets do
            not move through a Lightning network routing path from one
            party to another as open chained HTLCs the way Lightning-BTC
            does. Assets move from one UTXO to another on the Evrmore
            block chain under the control of Lightning interacting with
            the Evrmore on-chain UTXO Assets. Asset transactions are
            therefore affected by the block interval speed, mining cost,
            and security of the Evrmore blockchain. On the upside, there
            is no such thing as asset channel capacity to worry about,
            which makes EvrLight work just as efficiently for low volume
            fungible assets and NFTs as it does for high-volume
            stable-coin assets. The same cannot be said of any
            Lightning-native virtual colored coin scheme, for which
            channel capacity would make the scheme unusable for all but
            the highest volume stable coins. Note also that Evrlight
            transactions do not require the use of Watchtowers to
            prevent losing an asset. Either party is free to go offline
            as long as the asset seller heeds the HTLC refund timeout
            and the Lightning invoice expiry which he himself decides.
            Finally, it is worth saying that the basic idea of tying an
            asset layer to Lightning using HTLCs could be applied to
            other asset chains, but Evrmore's similarity to Bitcoin and
            its simplicity allow a tighter level of integration than is
            possible with other chains. EvrLight does require that both
            parties be on-line when an asset is bought or sold in order
            for the sale to be successful, as all these schemes do. A
            Lightning payment is made from one wallet to another, and
            the on-chain activity is a related side effect. In that
            sense it is no different that ZAPs, which are also Lightning
            wallet-to-wallet transactions which require that both
            parties be on-line or using a Lightning service provider who
            is on-line. The recipient of a ZAP must have his wallet
            online or the ZAP will fail. <br>
            <br>
            EvrLight does not promise the impossible at some time in the
            future after a new platform is built and achieves community
            consensus. EvrLight cannot deliver infinite scalability and
            near-instant settlement. But <u>EvrLight can deliver
              as-good-as-it-can-be peer-to-peer asset support which
              works just as well for NFTs as it does for stablecoins,
              with 2-minute 1-conf settlement time, low fees, and
              enhanced privacy, available as a protocol for developers
              to build into their applications today</u>. <br>
