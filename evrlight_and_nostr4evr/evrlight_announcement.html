            The announcement of EvrLight, which was made on Oct 31st
            2023 on the first anniversary of Evrmore's launch, is
            recorded here. It provides a good summary of why EvrLight is
            important and why it can be important to Nostr:<br>
            <br>
            <hr width="50%" size="2"> <br>
            Those of you who have followed my work know that much of it
            has focused on low-level protocol. In 2018 I began working
            with the Medici developers to debug Ravencoin's basic UTXO
            asset functionality, and eventually it led to the planned
            enhancements documented in the Evrmore whitepaper. But most
            importantly, I know that Evrmore must attract users and
            developers for real-world use cases. Doing so requires
            interfacing with other projects and communities. To
            accomplish that, I have increasingly focused on asset atomic
            swap technology as a key building block. I spent substantial
            effort 2 years ago debugging asset HTLCs on testnet and
            successfully executed cross-chain atomic swaps of assets in
            exchange for Bitcoin. I implemented that asset functionality
            with some needed bugfixes on Evrmore's mainnet when it
            launched a year ago. <br>
            <br>
            Earlier this year I went even deeper down the HTLC rabbit
            hole to understand in detail how Komodo's AtomicDEX
            technology functions and what it would take to support EVR
            and Evrmore Assets. I turned on EVR support in AtomicDEX but
            decided not to invest the time yet to implement Evrmore
            assets in AtomicDEX because I realized something much more
            important. <br>
            I realized that since <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Bitcoin and Evrmore are both based on
            UTXOs and addresses, <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Bitcoin-Lightning is based on HTLCs
            and secret-locked invoices, and<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Evrmore supports HTLCs for both EVR
            and Evrmore Assets in a very Bitcoin-like way, <br>
            that means something hugely important: <b>It means that
              Evrmore is the perfect Layer-1 for diverse Lightning
              assets in the same way that Bitcoin is the Layer-1 for
              Lightning money</b>. <br>
            <br>
            In retrospect it is obvious, like the way many of the best
            inventions are. This technology, which I call EvrLight, is
            an enhanced protocol based on BTC-Lightning submarine swap
            technology interacting with the Evrmore on-chain UTXO
            Assets. It takes advantage of the strengths of both Evrmore
            and Bitcoin-Lightning to enable users to buy and sell
            Evrmore Assets using only a Lightning-capable Bitcoin
            wallet, the EvrLight protocol, and associated automation
            code. It will enable transactions which are atomic and
            non-custodial, with low fees, and 1-conf average settlement
            time of just over 2 minutes. Moreover, the transactions will
            be privacy-enhanced because the Lightning invoice payment
            leaves no on-chain record of the source of the Bitcoins. I
            have been working through the details and have documented
            the first draft of my work for other developers to study,
            begin testing, and help generate reference code examples for
            different languages. It will take time for developers to
            implement it in applications before end users can enjoy its
            benefits. But it is certainly worth celebrating with this
            announcement on Evrmore's birthday. <br>
            <br>
            EvrLight will make it possible to build asset-based Commerce
            and DeFi applications for users who do not need to know
            anything about Evrmore. But all commerce, including a DEX,
            also requires an orderbook or other mechanism for buyers and
            sellers to communicate. Therefore I also want to highlight
            the strategic opportunity which is emerging from the Nostr
            protocol. Like Evrmore, Nostr embraces the core values of
            Bitcoin and a focus on protocols. From a technology
            viewpoint, Nostr is a perfect fit for EvrLight. Not only are
            many of the Nostr developers also Lightning developers, but
            Nostr's users generate a private/public key pair as their
            effective user ID, and that key can be directly translated
            to an Evrmore address. That means that, without any prior
            communication, you can directly interact with Nostr users
            for EvrLight transactions using their address and know that
            they will have the needed private key. <br>
            <br>
            Nostr is still a tiny project compared to its competitors,
            and one of the biggest challenges will be in finding a
            revenue model which can support the needed infrastructure
            and developers to compete with the well-financed social
            media titans. EvrLight can provide the tools to add powerful
            peer-to-peer social commerce and DeFi capabilities to Nostr.
            I am working on an EvrLight example application for Nostr
            and a list of apps worth writing, which I will promote under
            the name Nostr4Evr. I hope other developers will join me.
            Working with Nostr is a win-win opportunity. <br>
            <br>
            As most of you know and anyone can see in the <a
              href="https://evr.cryptoscope.io/">explorer</a>, we have
            accomplished our work this year without touching the
            minerdevfund. As the price of EVR rises, the Evrmore
            Foundation will begin using your minerdevfund as intended to
            pay a few part-time followed by full-time developer salaries
            and bounties to help speed up the pace of progress. <br>
            <br>
            There has never been a more exciting time for Evrmore. We
            are just getting started. Welcome to the new world where the
            EvrLight protocol will make it possible to buy and sell
            Evrmore assets using only a Lightning-capable Bitcoin
            wallet. See the <a href="https://evrmorecoin.org/">website</a>
            for more information. <br>
            <br>
            Happy Birthday Evrmore !!! <br>
