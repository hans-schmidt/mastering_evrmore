            Evrmore is a code and chain fork of Ravencoin, a
            proof-of-work GPU-mined blockchain forked from Bitcoin in
            2018. Like Bitcoin, Ravencoin was launched in a fair way
            with no premine or founder rewards, no masternodes, no
            staking. Evrmore was launched in late 2022 as a code-cleanup
            feature-enhanced datasize-reduction of Ravencoin, based on
            the same fairness principles. Evrmore made the sole
            compromise of creating a minerdevfund (10% of miner coinbase
            rewards) which we hope will help fund development in the
            future (no coins have yet been spent).
            <br>
            <br>
            Evrmore provides secure flexible fast inexpensive assets
            with human readable names guaranteed to be globally unique.
            Evrmore is a simple UTXO-based open permissionless
            decentralized noncustodial solution whose community shares
            the same values as Bitcoiners. We are Bitcoiners.
            <br>
            <br>
            An Evrmore transaction looks exactly like a Bitcoin
            transaction, except for the contents of some outputs. Most
            Evrmore transaction outputs looks exactly like a Bitcoin
            transaction output except that an Evrmore asset control
            script may be appended to the traditional scriptPubkey. The
            Evrmore block interval time is 1 minute.
            <br>
            <br>
            More details of Evrmore assets and the asset implementation
            are explained <a
href="../current_tech_docs/evrmore_overview_of_assets.html#asset_fundamentals">HERE</a>

            <br>
            With EvrLight, the newly-announced technology to couple
            Evrmore with Bitcoin-Lightning, casual Nostr users will be
            able to receive, buy, sell, or give away Evrmore assets
            atomically and noncustodially using only BTC-Lightning and
            associated automation code. Average 1-conf settlement time
            will be slightly over 2 minutes. Furthermore, the
            transactions will be privacy-enhanced because the Lightning
            invoice payment leaves no on-chain record of the source of
            the Bitcoins. EvrLight is an enhanced protocol based on
            BTC-Lightning submarine swap technology interacting with the
            Evrmore on-chain UTXO Assets. Lightning thereby acts as a
            payment rail and noncustodial controller for Evrmore assets.
            The result is that Evrmore functions as the Layer-1 for
            diverse Lightning assets in the same way that Bitcoin is the
            Layer-1 for Lightning money. <br>
            <br>
            For Nostr users, the UTXO on the Evrmore blockchain could
            hold assets and EVR at an Evrmore address which is
            equivalent to the Nostr user's npubkey and could therefore
            be spent by their nseckey. An alternate address could be
            specified by the user in their Nostr profile if desired and
            the user might specify a different user's npubkey if they
            are giving the asset to someone else. Assets which are
            intended for purchase or sale by Nostr users are prepared by
            bundling them with enough EVR coins to satisfy an
            anticipated number of Evrmore on-chain mining fees. No
            Bitcoin on-chain fees or confirmations are involved, so
            transactions confirm inexpensively within about two minutes
            on average. <br>
            <br>
            More complex asset operations such as issueing, reissueing,
            editing metadata, or extended trading after the bundled EVR
            are exhausted are in theory also possible using only a
            Lightning wallet and associated automation code. Lightning
            wallets with those capabilities may become available. But in
            the near term merchants should plan to use an Evrmore native
            wallet for those operations. Evrmore provides evrmore-qt
            (C++ desktop for Linux/Windows), electrum-evrmore (Python
            for Linux/Windows), and Moontree (Android) wallets.
            <br>
            <br>
            An overview of how EvrLight works, compared to how other
            Asset technologies interact with Bitcoin-Lightning and their
            limitations is explained <a
              href="technologies_for_assets_on_bitcoin_and_lightning.html">HERE</a>
            <br>
            Technical protocol details of EvrLight are documented <a

            Nostr and Lightning both face challenges in how to pay for
            the infrastructure and developers they need to prosper.
            Supporting flexible assets can help Nostr developers build
            the Social Commerce features needed for a global market
            community. Lightning node operators could increase their
            volume and income by being not only the fastest and least
            expensive way to buy things with Bitcoin, but by also
            becoming the standard way to buy tickets, subscriptions, and
            many other types of assets. We are confident that Evrmore
            will prevail as the best asset solution. But for the good of
            both Bitcoin, Lightning and Nostr, if you don't like
            something about Evrmore, try a different asset solution.
            Evrmore welcomes the opportunity to compete and win against
            other solutions.
