            Bitcoin's protocol and UTXO model have proven to be
            wonderfully secure. Ravencoin built on that base by adding
            simple enhancements to natively support assets. Evrmore
            plans to add similar enhancements allowing it to support
            partial order fulfillment, stop-limit orders, interest
            rates, options and futures contracts, and many other useful
            financial primitives. This will enable Evrmore to support
            much of the DeFi economy without the security risks inherent
            in overly complex smart contracts. <br>

                  <a name="Evrmore_Guiding_Principles"></a>Evrmore
                  Guiding Principles:</b></font></u><br>
            <b><br>
              <br>
              <u>Vision:</u></b> Extend the Ravencoin architecture with
            simple intuitive features designed to make Evrmore an
            excellent platform for DeFi. When core DeFi concepts become
            standardized, simple native support should be hard-coded
            into the Evrmore protocol.<br>
            <br>
            <u><b>Ecosystem:</b></u> Whenever possible, add new ways for
            Evrmore users and nodes to benefit financially from use of
            the chain. Successful participation in DeFi requires a rich
            ecosystem of participants earning money in a variety of
            ways.<br>
            <br>
            <u><b>Diversity:</b></u> Support for new functionality in
            Evrmore means changes to the protocols, data structures, and
            RPC calls as well as changes to the consensus rules in
            raven-qt/ravend. But it does not require GUI support in
            raven-qt for all its features because there will be far too
            many options and functions to support them all. GUI support
            and related services are best provided by ecosystem vendors
            through additional applications or websites on a for-profit
            basis. Just as TCP and HTML provide the low-level support on
            which internet businesses are built, the various low-level
            blockchain features of Evrmore will be able to support a
            range of product and service vendor businesses.<br>
            <br>
            <u><b>Scaling:</b></u> Adding new data fields to the
            transaction and UTXO specification will increase the on-disk
            and in-memory storage requirements and the sync time for
            full nodes, and therefore should be given appropriate
            consideration. However, the required increase to support
            most financial primitives is expected to be modest. Unlike
            account-based systems such as Ethereum or extended-UTXO
            systems such as Cardano, the changes will not be storing
            arbitrary persistent system state. Hence, radical changes in
            support of scaling are not expected to be necessarily for
            quite some time. Long term, technologies such as Utreexo or
            Flyclient could be adopted to reduce storage space
            requirements. For transaction throughput, larger block size
            has been demonstrated as an effective measure by a number of
            bitcoin fork projects. Beyond that, technologies such as
            rollups and sharding as being used by Ethereum, would be
            equally valid and simpler to deploy on Evrmoree.<br>
            <br>
            <u><b>Core Development Funding:</b></u> The Evrmore team
            respects the ethos adopted by Bitcoin- decentralized,
            permissionless, as simple as possible. Bitcoin's unique
            status and its very slow cautious development style are a
            good match. The DeFi market, however, is fast-moving and
            requires a more practical mechanism to fund full-time
            salaried core software developers. Some compromise is
            necessary and worthwhile in order to be competitive in DeFi.
            To that end, Evrmore charges a 10% development funding fee
            on all mining rewards<br>

            below for details.<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Unique assets can be given a lifetime ranging from 1
                hour to eternal. The price for creating the asset will
                vary from 0.05 EVR (1 hour life) to 5 EVR (eternal
                life). <br>
              </li>

                SIGHASH_SINGLE|SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY On-Chain Atomic
                Swaps by adding Asset_Name/Ask_Qty/Signature fields to
                every UTXO to communicate the desired trade. This makes
                it possible to do offer tracking and broadcast on-chain
                as a way to bootstrap initial DEX activity without
                requiring a new database of communication channel. DEX
                trading can also be taken off-chain to speed up activity
                and to save transaction fees.&nbsp; </li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            below for details.
            <ul>
              <li>Assets can be destroyed as well as issued. This
                capability is important for on-chain tokens which
                represent off-chain assets, such as wrapped-bitcoin, for
                which the number of tokens in existence should be
                adjusted up or down to match the number of bitcoin in
                escrow. As another example, assets can be issued as
                one-time-use utility tickets which are consumed
                (destroyed) when used. This is particularly useful when
                used with expiring unique assets (#11 below).</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            - Add Covenant support: See "<a moz-do-not-send="true"

            below for details.
            <ul>
              <li>Covenants will allow Evrmore script to support more
                complex smart contracts within limitations. In
                particular, an options contract or futures contract on
                the sale of a valuable token or stablecoin can reside in
                a separate contract token which can be traded separately
                from the value token. Recent research on the necessary
                contracts and the mechanism to link the contracts to a
                tradeable token separate from the underlying value asset
                token indicate that this is possible using the covenant
                opcode extensions which have already been in production
                use for a few years on Blockstream's Liquid Network
                blockchain. <br>

              <li>On-chain 2-step Atomic Swaps can support "Partial
                Order Fullfillment" with specified "Granularity". They
                can also support different order types:
                Precise(Legacy)/Market/Stop/Limit/Stop_Limit/Stop_Market.
                This primarily requires only new data fields in the UTXO
                definition and a change in the related consensus rules.
                Independent vendors are responsible for matching offer
                and seller half-transactions for submission to the

              <li>It is interesting to note that most of these features
                and Evrmore-like asset trading were proposed as a
                bitcoin extension by Mark Friedenbach in 2013 for his
                Freicoin project, but the project was dropped when Adam

            <ul>
              <li>On-chain 2-step Atomic Swap support for Oracle-based
                price discovery can provide another vast improvement in
                price discovery and flexibility. Markets use many
                different methods of price discovery. Some use
                traditional off-chain bid/ask order books. DeFi projects
                are experimenting with a variety of
                Automatic-Market-Maker algorithms. Oracle support allows
                the offer creator to select any Oracle of his choice
                based on the Oracle's public key and signed price
                reports. Only the price quote and signature format need
                to be standardized, and a few changes need to be made to
                the UTXO definition and consensus rules.&nbsp; The buyer
                can choose an Oracle from any independent vendor who
                provides that service on a for-profit basis. New
                technologies such as "Gravity Protocol" are expected to
                make Oracles much more common.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            - Implement a 2-way Peg BTC-Relay to provide Wrapped-BTC
            liquidity for trading. <br>
            <ul>
              <li>EVRWBTC tokens can be issued on the Evrmore blockchain
                specifying a non-zero toll, so the liquidity providers
                earn a toll every time a EVRWBTC token is traded.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Technically, the implementation is similar to a P2SH
                HTLC Cross-chain Atomic Swap. During a Peg-in it locks
                up BTC on the bitcoin blockchain and issues an equal
                number of EVRWBTC on the Evrmore blockchain. During a
                Peg-out, the EVRWBTC must be consumed and the BTC are
                returned on the bitcoin blockchain. If BTC and EVR had
                sufficiently powerful scripting, this could easily be
                fully automated as a Relay. Since that is not the case,
                and to improve security, many projects implement it as a
                Trusted Federation as done by Blockstream for LBTC on
                the Liquid blockchain, by Rootstock for RBTC on RSK, and
                by WBTC for Ethereum. In some juridiction, this solution
                creates KYC requirements for the users. Other projects
                use more complex solutions to fully automate the Relay
                such as by running both EVR and BTC chains and transfer
                code in a Trusted Execution Environment (as done by
                pTokens for pBTC) or running a Secure Multi-party
                Computation on distributed VMs (as done for Ren). The
                maturity of the available solutions and regulatory
                changes relating to stablecoins will dictate the best
                solution.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            - Implement a 2-way Peg Ethereum Relay to enable Wrapped
            ERC20 tokens on Evrmore. Same considerations as for
            BTC-Relay. <br>
            <br>
            - Implement Relays to additional popular blockchains: LTC,
            DOGE, BCH, Cosmos<br>
            <br>
            - Implement Reusable Payment Addresses: A mechanism which
            creates different non-linkable addresses so that on-chain
            balances and payment totals can remain private. This is a
            highly desired feature for businesses who want to advertise
            a payment address yet maintain some financial privacy.<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Similar technologies have been used on BCH
                (BIP-Stealth) and BTC (Stealth Addresses) as well as in
                Monero</li>
              <li>Note that this works better on Evrmore than on BTC or
                BCH because of EVR's common use of extraneous data
                on-chain (put the nonce in the IPFS field)</li>

                <li>There is no toll charged for a "Consume" operation
                  (consumes are not transfers), so a Wrapping token
                  which has a toll can be "cashed in" for its associated

                <li>The Toll is paid as a EVR output to the Toll

                  The second IPFS field will always be mutable, even for
                  unique assets and other non-reissuable assets (needs
                  additional RPC and GUI support). For backward
                  compatibility, legacy assets which are unique or
                  otherwise non-reissueable will have their IPFS mapped
                  to the non-mutable field, while legacy reissueable

                <li>If the token represents a "wrapped" asset such as
