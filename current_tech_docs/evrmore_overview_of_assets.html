<br>At this time, most transaction examples point to transactions on the Ravencoin blockchain, which is similar to Evrmore in those cases.
</p>

  <br />
  <p>This webpage will attempt to describe Evrmore assets at a high level, and then dig deeper into the technical implementation.

  <h2 id="asset_fundamentals">Evrmore Asset Fundamentals:</h2></a>
  
  <h3 id="what_is_an_asset"><u>What is an asset?</u></h3>

  <p>An Evrmore asset (sometimes referred to as a token) is an on-chain data object which contains user-generated information. An asset can be used as an event ticket, a subscription, a coupon, a badge, an authentication approval, a coin, a financial security, or a representation of a physical asset such as real estate, art, precious metal, etc. It is created and processed according to the blockchain consensus rules, which dictate the conditions under which it can be created, under which it can be moved (traded) to a different address, under which the enclosed information can be edited, and under which additional assets of the same type or derivative type may be created.  </p>
  <p>An Evrmore asset has a human-readable guaranteed unique name which is chosen by the user when created. </p>
  <p>In bitcoin terminology, every Evrmore asset is contained in a UTXO or group of UTXOs.</p>

  <br />
  <h3 id="where_can_i_trade_assets"><u>Where can I trade assets?</u></h3>
  <p>Marketplaces can be public, global, and free of regulation such as the EVRSea NFT Marketplace at <a href="https://evrsea.io">https://evrsea.io</a> which specializes in the trading of NFT art implemented as Evrmore assets. Other marketplaces are proprietary and require a membership. A financial security marketplace would require regulatory approvals based on the juristiction of the participants.</p>
  <br />

  <h3 id="privacy"><u>Privacy and Access</u></h3>
  <p>An Evrmore asset, like a Bitcoin, is held at a blockchain address and all movements on the chain are publicly viewable. Ownership of an asset is therefore pseudonomous based on knowledge of who owns which address. Some data contained in the asset, such as its name, are also publicly viewable. But other data, such as data pointed to by an IPFS link contained within the asset, could be encrypted so that only users who possess the decryption key can view that data.</p> 
  <p>The ability to buy and sell most assets is unrestricted beyond the requirement that the owner must prove ownership by proving possession of the keys associated with the address at which the asset resides. However, Evrmore does also support a special Restricted Asset type which is subject to a number of addtional restrictions including mechanisms to limit which addresses are allowed to receive the asset or to globally freeze and unfreeze trading for all addresses.</p>
  <br />

  <h3 id="the_nomenclature"><u>The Nomenclature</u></h3>
  <p>The following terms are commonly used to describe Evrmore asset capabilities or operations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4><u>Reissuability</u></h4>
      <p>This is a metadata flag which denotes whether or not an asset can be reissued, which also provides an opportunity to change some of the asset's metadata. Once this flag is set to false it CANNOT be changed back! If you want (or if there is even a small chance that you will want) to change your asset's information in the future, ensure that you issue your asset as reissuable when you create it!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4><u>Divisibility (Units)</u></h4>
      <p>Units is a metadata value from zero to eight which denotes how much an asset can be broken up. Specifically this number is how many digits past the decimal this asset can be divided into (a minimum size of 10<sup>-d</sup> where d is the divisibility).</p>Units=0 means the tokens are not divisible at all -- whole tokens only can be transferred.  Units=2 would be two decimal places like cents on a dollar it would be possible to transfer 0.01.   Units=8 is the most divisible and allows tokens to be tranferred in increments of 0.00000001.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4><u>Reissuing</u></h4>
      <p>Reissuing an asset is an act which does one or both of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Changing the metadata associated with an asset.</li>
        <li>Creating more of an asset.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>In order to reissue an asset, the asset must be reissuable and you must have the associated ownership asset.</p>
      <br />
      <p>When changing divisibility during a reissuance, the divisibility may only be kept the same or increased, never decreased.</p>
      <br />
      <p>When increasing divisibility, you cannot use the new lowest asset amount when creating more of the asset; the asset still has the old divisibility amount until the reissue transaction has been mined into a block</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4><u>Ownership Assets</u></h4>
      <p>When creating an asset of type "main", you will also receive an ownership asset. Ownship assets allow a user to reissue an asset and create "child assets" which we will explore in the next section. Ownership assets are designated by an exclamation point (!) appended to the chosen name of the Asset. For instance, for an asset created with the name "ASSET", the associated ownership asset would be "ASSET!". If an asset A requires the ownership asset of asset B to be created, asset B is said to be asset A's "parent" and asset A is said to be asset B's "child".</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4><u>Associated Data</u></h4>
      <p>This is a 32-byte data field which contains user-supplied data. It usually contains an <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS hash</a> or a Transaction Identifier (TXID), but it can be anything.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4><u>Message Broadcasts</u></h4>
      <p>Any owner of any asset can broadcast a 32 byte message associated with that asset. We will go more in-depth with broadcasts later.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4><u>Null Asset Tags</u></h4>
      <p>These are special <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script">scripts</a> used by holders of qualifier assets and restricted ownership assets to define behavior between restricted assets and addresses. The relationship between qualifiers, restricted assets, tags, and addresses is fairly complicated. We will go more in-depth further down the page.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <br />

  <h3 id="creating_assets"><u>Creating Assets</u></h3>
  <p>When creating an asset, you need to know what type of asset you want, the name you want for the asset, the quantity of the asset which you want to issue, how much it costs to create the asset, and the metadata you want associated with the asset.</p>
  <p>Assets are easily identified by their names, which must be unique. An asset creation will not be accepted by the chain if the name is not unique.</p>
  <p>Asset names are encoded using plain ascii. Therefore asset names can only contain characters in the latin alphabet.</p>
  <p>The cost of creating an asset can be viewed as the cost to "reserve the name" similar to purchasing a DNS name. The cost is not a function of the quantity of tokens issued of that asset.</p>
  <p>To put this information in a more readable format, all of the upcoming asset types will contain the following chart:</p>
   <table style="width:100%">

  <h3 id="main_assets_subassets_unique"><u>Main Assets, Subassets, and Unique Assets</u></h3>
  <p>When working with Evrmore assets you will most likely be using one of these three. They are by far the most used types of assets.</p>
  <br />
  <h4><u>Main assets</u></h4>
  <p>Using a website analogy, a main asset is like a domain name.</p>

  <p>The ownership asset of a main asset is required to create the following two asset types.</p>

  <br />

  <h4><u>Sub-assets</u></h4>
  <p>A sub-asset is like a path within a website or like a filesystem subdirectory. Creating a sub asset requires a main asset ownership token.</p>

  <table style="width:100%">
    <tr>
      <th>Metadata</th>
      <th>Information</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Asset Name</td>
      <td><p>The sub-portion of the name must be at least 1 capital letter. '.' and '_' are also allowed, but they cannot be at the beginning or end of the sub-portion. More than one of these special characters also cannot be next to one another.</p>
      <p>The full sub-asset name takes the form [main asset name]/[sub-portion]. This full name must be 30 or less characters.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ownership Asset</td>
      <td>Sub-assets have an associated ownership asset</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Prerequisites</td>
      <td>A main asset's ownership asset</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Asset Amount</td>
      <td>1 - 21,000,000,000 of this asset can be created</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cost</td>
      <td>100 EVR</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Reissuability</td>
      <td>This asset can be set to be reissued</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Associated Data</td>
      <td>This asset can have associated data</td>
    </tr>
  </table> 

  <br />

  <h4><u>Unique assets</u></h4>
  <p>A unique asset can be likened to a file on a website. Creating a unique asset requires a main asset ownership token or a sub-asset ownership token. There can only be 1 of a unique asset.</p>

  <table style="width:100%">
    <tr>
      <th>Metadata</th>
      <th>Information</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Asset Name</td>
      <td>The unique portion of the name must be at least 1 character. The full unique asset name takes the form [main or sub asset name]#[unique portion]. This full name must be 30 or less characters.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ownership Asset</td>
      <td>Unique assets have no associated ownership asset</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Prerequisites</td>
      <td>A main asset or sub-asset's ownership asset</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Asset Amount</td>
      <td>1 of this asset can be created</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>This asset can have associated data</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <br />
  <h3 id="broadcasts_and_messages"><u>Broadcasts and Message Channels</u></h3>
<p>Message Channel is an asset type which is defined in Evrmore. However, it is not supported in any of the mainstream community software releases, and it is rarely used. It is included here only for the sake of completeness. </p>
  <h4><u>Asset Messages</u></h4>
  <p>Any user can send an asset message on any asset of any type which they own. An asset message is a 34 bytes long data field in any asset transfer transaction which the user can set to carry a message. It uses the same datafield which is used to associate an IPFS link or Transaction ID as metadata to an asset when the asset is created or reissued. During other asset operations it just becomes usable as a general purpose message field. When the transfer is to another address, the message is interpreted to be intended to be directed to the owner of that address.</p>
  <h4><u>Asset Broadcasts</u></h4>
  <p>In a message channel asset transfer transaction, if the receiving address is the same as the sending address, this is interpreted as a message broadcast. Only message channels can broadcast messages. It is important to note that the term "broadcast" is actually a misnomer since there is nothing being sent to multiple destinations beyond the usual transaction relaying. It is solely a scheme by which the client software could interpret use of the data field in a transaction, but no such user interface for message broadcasts has been implemented in the core wallet and may never be implemented.</p>
  <h4><u>Message Channels</u></h4>
  <p>A message channel requires a main or sub-asset's ownership asset. A message channel is an asset specifically made for broadcasting messages. Their purpose is to add more control to whoever
  might be subscribed to the message channel's parent.</p>
  <p>On-chain messages are a very limited and expensive way to send messages because the data field is very small and because every transaction costs a transaction fee. On the other hand, the data field size problem can be avoided by making it a link to (possibly changing) data off-chain. Also, the transaction fees do provide a mechanism to discourage spam.</p>
  <table style="width:100%">

      <th>Information</th>

  <h3 id="qualifiers_restricted_tags"><u>Qualifiers, restricted assets, addresses, and tags</u></h3>
  <p>Restricted assets, qualifiers, address tagging, and other related items are a complex topic. They are fully supported on-chain and in the Evrmore core code. And you may find an interesting way to use them in your application. But it is more likely that you won't need to understand or use them. They were created specifically to support the regulatory requirements of Security Token Offerings, Financial Security trading, and the required Know-Your-Customer regulations. Restricted assets are restricted in the sense that only certain addresses may receive them. Those address must satisfy the requirements of a "Verifier String" defined for that Restricted Asset. A Verifier String is a boolean expressed composed from Qualifier names. Qualifier names are the names of Qualifier Assets which represent the satisfaction of some requirement such as having been KYC vetted or being a member of a club. Addresses can be tagged or untagged by the holder of a Qualifier Asset, and the result of those address tagging operations must satisfy the boolean Verifier String in order for that address to receive the Restricted Asset. The creator of a Qualifier Asset can create more than one of them with the same name, which he can give to other addresses, effectively delegating to the owner of that address the ability to tag any address on his behalf with the Qualifier.</p>
  <p>Lets start out with some definitions.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
    <h4><u>Asset Tags</u></h4>
    <p>An asset tag determines whether or not an address is able to receive a restricted asset. It costs 0.1 EVR to create an asset tag. There are three types of asset tags:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><h5><u>Null Asset Tag</u></h5>
    <p>A null asset tag has two sub-types:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Qualifying Null Asset Tag: This type of null asset tag can be created with a qualifier asset. It qualifies or unqualifies some address.</li>
    <li>Restricted Null Asset Tag: This type of null asset tag can be created with a restricted asset's ownership asset. It can add or remove an address from being blacklisted from receiving this restricted asset
     no matter the address's qualifications.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h5><u>Verifier Asset Tag</u></h5>
    <p>A verifier asset tag can be created with a restricted asset's ownership asset. It associates this restricted asset with one or more qualifiers. (This
   means that to recieve this restricted asset, an address must be qualified by all of the qualifiers defined in this tag).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h5><u>Restricted Asset Tag</u></h5>
    <p>Also known as a global freeze tag, a restricted asset tag can be created with a restricted asset's ownership asset. This tag
     can freeze or unfreeze all movements across all addresses of this restricted asset.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h4><u>Qualifier Asset</u></h4>
    <p>Qualifier assets are administrative assets (in the same group as ownership assets) used to determine what addresses can receive restricted assets. Simply owning a qualifier asset gives a user this power.</p>
    <table style="width:100%">
    <tr>
      <th>Metadata</th>
      <th>Information</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Asset Name</td>
      <td><p>The qualifier portion of the name has the same naming rules as a main asset.</p>
      <p>The qualifier asset name takes the form #[qualifier portion]. Note how this is differentiated from unique assets with the fact that a qualifier has no parent. This full name must be less than 30 characters.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ownership Asset</td>
      <td>Qualifier assets have no associated ownership asset</td>

<h2 id="asset_technicals">Evrmore Asset Technical Implementation:</h2></a>

<h3><u>TLDR:</u></h3> 

<p>If you understand Bitcoin's transaction and UTXO
structures and you just want to see an example of how
Evrmore differs from Bitcoin in order to support Assets,
then look <a href="bitcoin_vs_evrmore_txn_comparison.html">HERE</a>
</p>
<br>

  <h3 id="what_is_on_chain"><u>What is stored on the chain?</u></h3>
  <p>All asset creations, reissues, transfers, and tags are special scripts and are part of normal transactions.
  </p>
  <p>When an asset is created, nodes store the asset name, reissuability, divisions, associated data, and respective VOUT information in a database. This is how nodes easily access metadata. During a reissuance, the ownership asset must be sent to prove ownership on-chain and the node will save the new metadata. These asset creation and reissuance transactions are the only places where the metadata is stored on the chain.</p>
  <p>This means that, say, a 3rd party wallet sends you asset information. Whatever protocol they are using will need to send the client the VOUT of asset creations or reissues so that the client may verify the integrity of the metadata.</p>
  <p>The same is true for asset tags. They only exist on the chain in one singular transaction. The node then keeps track of where that transaction is in a database for verification later.</p>
  <p>As discussed earlier, there is also an optional 34-byte data field in the asset script portion of any asset transaction. During creation or reissue of an asset, that datafield determines the IPFS or TXID metadata attached to the asset. During other asset operations it can serve as a general purpose message field.</p>

  <br />
  <h3 id="burn_addresses"><u>Burn Addresses and Cost of Asset Operations</u></h3>
  <p>In order to create an asset, a certain amount of EVR must be sent to a burn address.</p>
  <p>The first two characters are due to Evrmore's P2PKH address type of 0x21 and the seeming random characters at the end of each address are the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/File:Address_map.jpg">public key's checksum</a>.</p>

  <p>Just like the pirate by-laws, the OP_PUSH after OP_EVR_ASSET can be seen more as a suggestion rather than a rule-of-thumb. Currently nodes accept assets based on whether or not the ‘evr’ is within 1 or 2 bytes after OP_EVR_ASSET instead of actually reading the OP_PUSH after OP_EVR_ASSET. Because of this, there are some transactions on the chain that have non-standard bytes after OP_EVR_ASSET. (Including lengths that are greater or less than the asset data or bytes that are greater than OP_PUSHDATA4).</p>
  <p>If you only want to track ‘good’ transactions you can ignore these, as the vast majority of transactions follow proper serialization protocols. However, these malformed transactions are in fact ‘valid’ outpoints (for now) and if you want an all-encompassing tracking of the chain, you will need to check for these edge cases.</p>
  <p>See <a href="https://github.com/EvrmoreOrg/electrumx-evrmore/blob/fc59b07c4ffcaae25a49a1b7a74a955067f350c2/electrumx/server/block_processor.py#L787">here</a> for an example of a full chain parsing or <a href="https://github.com/EvrmoreOrg/electrumx-evrmore/blob/fc59b07c4ffcaae25a49a1b7a74a955067f350c2/electrumx/server/mempool.py#L418">here</a> for a best-effort parsing.</p>

  <h3 id="create_transactions"><u>Asset transaction structures</u></h3>
  <p>Similar to normal Evrmore (and bitcoin) transactions, the amount of an asset from the VINS must equal the amount in the VOUTS (Not including created assets).
  <br>A EVR fee must be paid for asset-only transactions just like any other.
  <br>All of the protocols pertaining to transactions are the same. The only thing that changes is the scripts.
  <br>The order of the VOUTS <i>does</i> matter when creating and reissuing assets.
  <br>When creating transactions the created ownership asset (if there is one) must be sent to the same address as the created asset.</p>
